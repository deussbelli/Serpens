## Overview
**Serpens** is an advanced encryption machine designed for encrypting and decrypting text and images using various sophisticated ciphers. This project is perfect for those who are interested in cryptography and want to explore the inner workings of different encryption algorithms, both standard and custom implementations.

## Features
Serpens provides encryption and decryption capabilities using the following ciphers:

- **DES (Library Implementation)**: A standard Data Encryption Standard implementation using library functions.
- **DES (Custom Implementation)**: A unique implementation of the DES algorithm created from scratch for educational and experimental purposes.
- **AES (Library Implementation)**: The Advanced Encryption Standard implemented using well-established libraries.
- **AES (Custom Implementation)**: A hand-coded version of AES, offering insights into the encryption process.
- **BBS (Blum Blum Shub)**: A pseudorandom number generator used for cryptographic purposes.
- **Merkle-Hellman**: A knapsack-based public-key cryptosystem.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deussbelli/Serpens.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Serpens
   ```
3. Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred C# IDE.
4. Build and run the project to start using Serpens.

## Usage
1. Select the type of cipher you want to use from the available options.
2. Choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt a text or an image.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to provide necessary inputs such as text, images, or keys.
4. View the output after processing is complete.
